security:
des & aes | enc & dec \ hash functions like gmac ...
renewed the api
dataflow in kernel is currently not used, because the kernel has to be configured by user
only seq mode currently
user have to build xclbin theirselves
a xclbin that contains many kernels results in very slow execution speed in hardware emulation
did a little modification to the library(gmac) because of the non-template functions
hash functions like gmac need to be done later

data compression:
target? file or memory
plan: reuse their commpn lib 
free running kernel has to be configured by user. How to deal with that?
