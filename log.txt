security:
des & aes | enc & dec \ hash functions like gmac ...
renewed the api
dataflow in kernel is currently not used
only seq mode currently
user have to build xclbin theirselves
a xclbin that contains many kernels results in very slow execution speed in hardware emulation
did a little modification to the library(gmac) because of the non-template functions
hash functions like gmac need to be done later

data compression:
target? file or memory
plan: reuse their commpn lib
